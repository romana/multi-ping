    Combine send and receive measurement into single function.

    This offers a retry mechanism: Overall timeout time is divided by
    number of retries. Additional ICMPecho packets are sent to those
    addresses from which we have not received answers, yet.

    The retry mechanism is useful, because individual ICMP packets may get
    lost.

    If 'retry' is set to 0 then only a single packet is sent to each
    address.

    If 'ignore_lookup_errors' is set then any issues with resolving target
    names or looking up their address information will silently be ignored.
    Those targets simply appear in the 'no_results' return list.

    The 'delay' parameter can be used to introduced a small delay between
    each requests.
